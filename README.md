## Abstract
Music genre classification is a crucial task in various music-related applications such as recommendation systems and search engines. This project aims to implement a deep learning model for accurately predicting the genre of a given piece of music. Deep learning methods, including LSTM, CNN, and Transformer architectures, will be explored for feature learning and classification.


## Steps
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collect the GTZAN dataset.
   - Preprocess audio files, including normalization, segmentation, and feature extraction using techniques such as Fourier transforms, MFCCs, and spectrograms.
2. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
3. **Model Architecture**:
   - Design or adapt LSTM, CNN, and/or Transformer architectures for music genre classification.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Train the model on the training set using an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
   - Start with two music genres and gradually increase the number of genres.
   - Shorten the length of analyzed music clips as needed.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of layers, and number of filters to improve performance on the validation set.
6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
7. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the model's output to demonstrate its ability to accurately classify music by genre.
